Example - 
Query : 24.48.0.1

### Feature num 2 - Client Subnet and DNS server API -  

Call the API by sending HTTP GET requests to
```
http://[32 random alphanumeric characters].edns.ip-api.com/json

you can run automatic redirection by this HTTP requests 

```
http://edns.ip-api.com/json
```

```
Example - 
HTTP GET requests - http://edns.ip-api.com/json

response : 
{
    "dns": {
        "ip": "74.125.73.83",
        "geo": "United States - Google"
    },
    "edns": {
        "ip": "91.198.174.0",
